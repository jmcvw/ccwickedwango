An R package to be filled with loads of functions that will be useful for teaching on CodeClan data analysis courses.

And for improving our R / general dev skills.

- Good ideas for functions might be:
  - anything that eases our teaching workflow.
  - anything that eases our marking workflow.
  - anything that helps you personally,
  - or anything that might be more generally helpful.
  - anything that can automate any repeated tasks.


## Proposed style guide

Everything here is up for discussion, and can be changed on an ongoing basis.
Add to it anything you think is a good idea.
Remove anything you don't (except the last point below).

- Let's use the native R pipe `|>`(?) where possible.
- Let's commit to fully documenting any functions we contribute to the package.
- Let's try and work in a collaborative way
    - Add new functions in git branches
    - Ask for code review from each other
    - Perform code reviews for each other
- Single quotes for the win ðŸ˜Š
