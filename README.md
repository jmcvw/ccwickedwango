# CC Wicked Wango

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE README.md FILE DIRECTLY. -->
<!-- INSTEAD EDIT README.qmd -->

An R package to be filled with loads of functions that will be useful
for teaching on CodeClan data analysis courses.

And for improving our R / general dev skills.

- Good ideas for functions might be:
  - anything that eases our teaching workflow.
  - anything that eases our marking workflow.
  - anything that helps you personally,
  - or anything that might be more generally helpful.

## Proposed style guide

Everything here is up for discussion, and can be changed on an ongoing
basis.

- Let’s use the native R pipe `|>`(?) where possible.
- Let’s commit to fully documenting any functions we contribute to the
  package.
- Let’s try and work in a collaborative way
  - Add new functions in git branches
  - Ask for code review from each other
  - Perform code reviews for each other
- Single quotes for the win 😊
